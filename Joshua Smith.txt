My role is backend. I focus on building reliable APIs, data models, and integrations, and I write clean tests to keep things stable. I also have full-stack experience (frontend + backend), so I design endpoints that make the UI fast and simple to use. For this project Iâ€™ll own the backend structure and documentation, coordinate interface contracts with frontend, and make sure what we ship looks good and serves a real purpose.
